## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Soft, muted green (#8FBC8F) to reflect the 'GreenShield' name and eco-friendly solutions, conveying trustworthiness and environmental responsibility.
- Background color: Light off-white (#F5F5F5) to create a clean, modern, and airy feel, ensuring readability and a welcoming aesthetic.
- Accent color: Earthy brown (#A0522D) to complement the green, adding warmth and a natural feel that is suitable for call-to-action emphasis and other important page elements.
- Headline font: 'Playfair' (serif) for an elegant, high-end feel on titles, paired with 'PT Sans' (sans-serif) as a versatile body text.  Playfair would be used only for titles or short snippets of text, whereas PT Sans would be suitable for larger amounts of body text
- Use a custom 'Eco Shield' motif throughout the site as badges, dividers, and icons to reinforce brand identity and the eco-friendly focus. Icons should be simple, modern line icons with rounded corners.
- Airy layout with generous spacing, rounded corners, and soft shadows to create a modern, approachable, and premium feel. A sticky header will be included with a logo, navigation, a visible phone number on desktop, and a prominent 'Call Now' button on mobile and desktop.
- Subtle, smooth animations and micro-interactions, such as button hover/tap states and card lifts, using Framer Motion to enhance user engagement without distraction.
